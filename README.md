### Assignment 0 ... Thoughts & Observations on NLP
This [assignment](https://github.com/nina-rao/HLT/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf) details NLP, various NLP approaches, and a reflection on my interest in the subject

### Assignment 1 ... Text Processing with Python
This [program](https://github.com/nina-rao/HLT/blob/main/asgn1.py) takes in an employee file, cleans the data, and outputs the data. To run it, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located. Then type python [name of py file] [relative path of data file] 
e.g. python asgn1.py data/data.csv
Compared to other programming languages, text processing with Python is a fairly painless process (as painless as text processing can be). There are many libraries and functions that take care of tasks that would otherwise take multiple lines of code. I found that many of the redundant aspects of normalizing text could be condensed into a single line. However for someone who isn't fully aware of the many Python resources at their disposal, it could be difficult especially considering Python is not a strongly typed language. This may be offputting to those used to working with languages like C++ or Java.
This assignment was an introduction to many concepts for me such as making a program universally compilable regardless of OS, pickling files, working with DataFrames, and Python structures in general. I have only used Python for the odd class assignment or small personal project and since I use it so infrequently I had to familiarize myself with much of the syntax and data structures. The utilization of RegEx was a refresher for me, and trying to match the phone numbers was a tedious puzzle.
